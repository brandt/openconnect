Description:

This directory contains a JNI interface layer for libopenconnect, and a
demo program to show how it can be used.

Build instructions:

From the top level, run:

    ./configure --with-java
    make
    cd java
    ant
    sudo java -Djava.library.path=../.libs -jar dist/example.jar <server_name> [protocol]

If ocproxy[1] is installed somewhere in your $PATH, this can be run as a
non-root user and it should be pingable from across the VPN.

Test/demo code is in src/com/example/
OpenConnect wrapper library is in src/org/infradead/libopenconnect/
